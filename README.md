This is a fancy and interactive dashboard to

1. Visualize users' journey on our product (not only single funnel path, but the complete network constituting all possible paths)
2. Perform conversion attribution analysis based on 1st order Markovian attribution model (relative importance of a preceding funnel to the conversion – one can define reaching a specific funnel as the conversion)
3. Perform position dependent conversion analysis (suppose one user is now at some funnel, what is the possibility for the user to reach the final conversion – again, one can customize conversion)?

This dashboard initially aims to help us understand how users utilize/interact with our mobile APP and supply insights on APP diagnosis.
